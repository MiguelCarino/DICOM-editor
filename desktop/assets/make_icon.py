"""Generate the Carino mark — the app and packaging icons — with the standard
library only (no Pillow), so a build machine needs nothing installed.

Ported verbatim from Carino-PACS/desktop/assets/make_icon.py apart from the
__main__ block: the mark is the shared Carino brand and both products must show
the same one, so the geometry below is not this app's to vary. The tray step is
gone, because the editor is a document app and has no tray.

The mark is a bold C: a ring of 90-degree mouth, cut radially at both terminals,
in Carino gold on transparency. It is drawn from the constants below rather than
traced from a bitmap, so any size can be regenerated exactly. That is the point
here: this repo's only image is a 50x50 logo.webp, which no amount of upscaling
turns into a crisp 1024px ic10 member.

Beware: that logo.webp is ALSO the wrong mark. It is the hand-drawn face this
project used before the fleet settled on the C, and the PACS repo's vendored
copy of this editor already carries the C instead. Regenerating it needs
ImageMagick and is out of scope for the desktop build, which must not touch
index.html or its assets — see the note printed at the end of this script.

Run:  python3 make_icon.py
